Mycroft Core is the primary module that makes up the Mycroft Artificial Intelligence platform. Mycroft makes use of the Adapt Intent Parser, Speech-to-Text software, and Text-to-Speech. The idea behind the platform is to be able to voice enable any device and turn it into a smart personal assistant, able to perform a variety of tasks. Mycroft is often used to refer to the hardware product produced by Mycroft AI, Inc. - so to avoid confusion, the software stack is often referred to as "Mycroft Core".

### Why Use Mycroft?

The Mycroft platform offers many great advantages over its competitors in the space, they are outlined below:

#### Permissive Open Source License
The first and greatest of which is its permissive, open source license. Mycroft is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0., which allows developers to take, extend, and integrate the software where and how they see fit. This allows any developer to voice-enable their projects with little hassle, and for free.

#### Community
Also, Mycroft has a growing community of contributors which enables the project to move quickly and address many different use-cases. Some of which that have already been discussed are use in: robotics, vehicles, home automation, and gaming.

#### Lightweight
The team and community have worked hard to lower Mycroft's resource requirements, with the goal of allowing the software to run on the lightest hardware possible. It is our hope that Mycroft will be able to voice-enable embedded devices across a wide spectrum.

#### Why Open Source?
Open Source software underpins the Internet and impacts all of us every day.  Artificial Intelligence software like Mycroft is becoming more and more important, but very little of it is open source.   We believe that projects like Mycroft are going to be key to the success of future products and technologies.   By sharing our software we believe that we can help bring artificial intelligence to the open source community where it can be used to benefit millions of users world wide.

It is our hope to work with other open source initiatives like TensorFlow and OpenAI to ensure that the future of artificial intelligence is open for all.
