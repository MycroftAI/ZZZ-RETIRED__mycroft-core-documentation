## Cerberus Device and Account Manager
Mycroft AI, Inc. - the company behind Mycroft maintains the Cerberus device and account management system. Developers can sign up at https://cerberus.mycroft.ai

By default the Mycroft software is configured to use Cerberus, upon any request such as "Hey Mycroft, what is the weather?", you will be informed that you need to pair and Mycroft will speak a 6-digit code, which you enter into the pairing page on the [Cerberus site](https://cerberus.mycroft.ai).

### Getting the pairing code
![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk0-termcode.png)
First, you need to get the pairing code from Mycroft. To do this, say `Mycroft, register my device`. Listen for what he says or if you are running Mycroft in a terminal, you can look at the terminal running the voice process. You should be able to see what code he says, as shown in the lower right corner of the image above.

### Pairing with Cerberus
![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk1-portal.png)
Go to cerberus.mycroft.ai and click the `Sign in with Google` link. 
(Note: we are working to support authentication methods other than Google. Stay tuned for those changes and an updated guide for them.)

![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk2-chooseaccount.png)
Select the Google account you want to use with your Cerberus account.

![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk3-permissions.png)
Select Allow on the next page to allow Mycroft access to basic information about your account.

![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk4-homepage.png)
Select Premium Backer on the homepage, or Continue to Pair Device if you do not want to be a premium backer.

![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk5-pairing.png)
Put the pairing code that you got from Mycroft in the first step into the box on this page and click Submit.

![Cerberus portal page](../CerbWalk6-registered.png)
Once registered, your Mycroft device should show on your list of paired devices.

Once signed and a device is paired, the unit will use our API keys for services, such as the STT (Speech-to-Text) API. It also uses allows you to use our API keys for weather, Wolfram-Alpha, and various other skills.

Pairing information generated by registering with Cerberus is stored in:

`~/.mycroft/identity/identity.json` <b><-- DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH OTHERS!</b>

It's useful to know the location of the identity file when troubleshooting device pairing issues.

## Using Mycroft without Cerberus.
If you do not wish to use our service, you may insert your own API keys into the configuration files listed below in <b>configuration</b>.

The place to insert the API key looks like the following:

`[WeatherSkill]`

`api_key = ""`

Put the relevant key in between the quotes and Mycroft Core should begin to use the key immediately.

### API Key services

- [STT API, Google STT](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys)
- [Weather Skill API, OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Wolfram-Alpha Skill](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)

These are the keys currently in use in Mycroft Core.
