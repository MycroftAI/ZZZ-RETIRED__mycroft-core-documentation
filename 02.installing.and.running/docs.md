# Introduction
This document is a work in progress and will be continually updated and fixed during the development cycle as we find and work on new issues and features.

The below sections should walk you through the process of setting up Mycroft-core in Linux environments (for now) with available dependencies. There is also a guide to set up Mycroft on Raspberry Pi via the Picroft image. The sections also discuss starting and using the services, pairing with home.mycroft.ai, and debugging various issues. Feel free to join our discussions about Mycroft in our Slack channels and official forums, and check out the [contributing section](https://docs.mycroft.ai/contributing) to learn more about contributing.
